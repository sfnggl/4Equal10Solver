# 4 = 10 Solver

Small scale agent and parser to solve the 4=10 Mobile game app.

## Why?

I was playing the game and it got very repetitive so I decided to implement an automatic solver, might scale this up to solve a more generalized version, X=Y, using more nested compound expressions and math functions.
